# BANK-S-TELEMARTING-BUSINESS-PROBLEM
The objective is to find the attributes of customers who are likely to buy the product when contacted through telemarketing. This is a classic case of acquisition analytics where companies use past data to predict the customers who are likely to buy certain products.
Here I have take an example of a bankâ€™s telemarketing business problem to understand the types of customers that should be targeted for future marketing campaigns. The data set contains demographic and personal information of about 45,000 people, and their response to a telemarketing campaign, i.e., whether they bought a certain product when contacted by the company through telemarketing.
I have used concepts like PIVOT Tables to analyse data, VLOOKUP to combine data from multiple sources, Formulae in Excel, Complex functions, Cell referencing and text functions, Logical formulae, Creating and formatting charts in Excel, Choosing the right type of chart.
